        "\n",
        "- **`import torch`**: This imports the main torch library, which is the core of PyTorch. PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that allows for building and training neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`import torchvision`**: This imports the torchvision library, which is part of the PyTorch project. It provides access to popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torch import nn`**: This imports the `nn` module from torch. The `nn` module provides a set of building blocks for creating neural networks, such as layers (like convolutional layers, linear layers), activation functions, and loss functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss`**: This specifically imports the `CrossEntropyLoss` class from the `torch.nn` module. This is a common loss function used for classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torch.optim import Adam`**: This imports the Adam optimizer from the `torch.optim` module. Optimizers are algorithms used to update the weights of a neural network during training to minimize the loss function. Adam is a popular and effective optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset`**: This imports the `DataLoader` and `Dataset` classes from `torch.utils.data`. The `Dataset` class is used to represent a collection of data samples, while the `DataLoader` class provides an efficient way to iterate over the dataset in batches during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torchvision import transforms`**: This imports the `transforms` module from torchvision. The `transforms` module provides a collection of common image transformations that can be applied to images for data augmentation and preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder`**: This imports the `ImageFolder` class from `torchvision.datasets`. This class is a convenient way to load image datasets organized in a specific folder structure where the class labels are inferred from the directory names.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from torchvision.models import ResNet152_Weights, resnet152`**: This imports the `resnet152` model architecture and its default weights (`ResNet152_Weights`) from the `torchvision.models` module.

        "This section of the code defines a sequence of image transformations that will be applied to the images in the dataset. These transformations are used for data augmentation, which helps to increase the size and variability of the training data. This can improve the generalization ability of the trained model and prevent overfitting. The `transforms.Compose` function is used to chain multiple transformations together to be applied in a specific order.\n",

        "Here's a breakdown of each transformation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.Resize((256, 256))`**: This transformation resizes the input image to a fixed size of 256x256 pixels. This is often done to ensure that all images have a consistent size before being fed into a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.RandomCrop((224, 224))`**: This transformation randomly crops a section of size 224x224 pixels from the resized image. Random cropping introduces variability in the training data by forcing the model to learn features from different parts of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5)`**: This transformation randomly flips the image vertically with a probability of 0.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5)`**: This transformation randomly flips the image horizontally with a probability of 0.5. Flipping the image both vertically and horizontally helps the model become invariant to the orientation of objects in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=30)`**: This transformation randomly rotates the image by an angle between -30 and +30 degrees. Random rotation helps the model become robust to variations in the rotation of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.ToTensor()`**: This transformation converts the image from a PIL Image or a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor. It also scales the pixel values to the range [0, 1]. This is necessary because PyTorch models work with tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])`**: This transformation normalizes the tensor image with the specified mean and standard deviation for each color channel (Red, Green, Blue). Normalization is a common preprocessing step that helps to standardize the input data and can improve the training process. The values used here are common mean and standard deviation values for images pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.\n"

        "This section of the code is related to controlling which parts of the neural network model will be updated during the training process. In deep learning, especially when using pre-trained models (although in this case, the model is initialized with random weights), it's common to selectively train only certain layers of the network. This is often done to fine-tune the model for a specific task while keeping the initial learned features from the earlier layers fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The line you are asking about specifically focuses on the final fully connected layer (often named `fc` in many common network architectures like ResNet) of the `resnet_model_for_cnc`.\n",

        "Let's break this down:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`resnet_model_for_cnc.fc`**: This accesses the fully connected layer of the `resnet_model_for_cnc` object. In a standard ResNet, this is the layer that takes the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers and maps them to the final class predictions.\n",
        "*   **`.requires_grad_()`**: This is a method available for PyTorch tensors and modules that allows you to set the `requires_grad` attribute. The underscore at the end of the method name (`_`) indicates that this operation modifies the object in place.\n",
        "*   **`requires_grad=True`:** This argument sets the `requires_grad` attribute of the parameters within the fully connected layer to `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What does `requires_grad=True` mean?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In PyTorch, the `requires_grad` attribute is crucial for the automatic differentiation engine (autograd). When `requires_grad` is set to `True` for a tensor or the parameters within a module, PyTorch will keep track of the operations performed on that tensor or module during the forward pass. This allows PyTorch to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to these parameters during the backward pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "By setting `resnet_model_for_cnc.fc.requires_grad_` to `True`, you are indicating that the weights and biases of the final fully connected layer **should** be updated during the training process. This means that the optimization algorithm (defined later in the notebook) will calculate the gradients for these parameters and adjust them to minimize the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, in the previous code cell, `resnet_model_for_cnc.requires_grad_(requires_grad=False)` was executed. This sets the `requires_grad` attribute to `False` for *all* parameters in the entire `resnet_model_for_cnc` model. This effectively \"freezes\" the weights of the pre-trained layers (the convolutional and pooling layers before the final fully connected layer), meaning they will not be updated during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the combined effect of these two lines is to freeze the weights of the majority of the ResNet152 model and only allow the parameters of the final fully connected layer to be trained. This is a common strategy for transfer learning, where you use a pre-trained model as a feature extractor and train a new classification head (the fully connected layer) on your specific dataset. Even when training from scratch, you might selectively freeze layers during initial training phases."

        "- **`torch.nn.Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=512)`**: This creates the first new layer, which is a linear (or fully connected) layer. It takes an input of size 2048 (which is the output size of the ResNet's layers before the original `fc` layer) and outputs a tensor of size 512. This layer acts as an intermediate layer in the new classification head.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`torch.nn.ReLU()`**: This adds a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function after the first linear layer. ReLU introduces non-linearity into the model, which is essential for learning complex patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`torch.nn.Dropout(p=0.2)`**: This adds a Dropout layer with a dropout probability of 0.2. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training. This helps prevent the model from overfitting by making it less reliant on specific neurons.\n",

The `len(dataset_of_cnc.classes)` dynamically gets the number of unique classes identified when the `ImageFolder` dataset was created. This layer is the final output layer of your redefined classification head.\n",

It converts the raw output scores (logits) from the linear layer into probabilities, where each probability represents the likelihood of the input belonging to a specific class. The `dim=1` argument specifies that the Softmax operation should be applied across the class dimension.\n",
