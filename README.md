Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the differences between LSP, linters, formatters, type checkers, and build tools, including key points and examples:

### 1. Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- **Definition**: A protocol for providing language-specific features in code editors and IDEs.
- **Purpose**: Standardizes communication between editors and language servers for features like autocompletion and error checking.
- **Example**: Python LSP servers like `python-lsp-server` and `Pyright`.

### 2. Linter
- **Definition**: A tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, stylistic issues, and potential bugs.
- **Purpose**: Improves code quality by identifying issues before runtime and enforcing coding standards.
- **Example**: `Pylint`, `Flake8`, and `mypy` for Python.

### 3. Formatter
- **Definition**: A tool that automatically formats code according to predefined style guidelines.
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent code style, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Example**: `Black` and `autopep8` for Python.

### 4. Type Checker
- **Definition**: Analyzes code to ensure variables and functions are used with the correct types.
- **Purpose**: Improves code reliability by catching type-related errors before runtime.
- **Example**: `mypy` for static type checking in Python.

### 5. Build Tools
- **Definition**: Automate the process of compiling code, packaging applications, and managing dependencies.
- **Purpose**: Streamlines development by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Example**: `setuptools`, `poetry`, and `pip` for managing Python projects.

### Summary
- **LSP**: Protocol for language features in editors.
- **Linter**: Analyzes code for errors and style issues.
- **Formatter**: Automatically formats code to adhere to style guidelines.
- **Type Checker**: Ensures type correctness in code.
- **Build Tools**: Automate building and packaging applications.

These tools work together to enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity in software development.


# So, To remove any conflict on vscode 
### Use these only ..(maybe .)
## pylance causing the problem 
- python default
- ruff / autopep8
- pyright
- python debugger(not nexessary )
- but pylance works when using mypy
- i need to restart pylance everytime
